         <p>Hello everybody, my name is Lucia, I come from Bogotá, Colombia.
            I am currently studying at Algonquin College in the city of Ottawa.I arrived in Canada on December 11<sup>th</sup> on a windy night. So far it has been a great experience. I love the snow but the cold, not so much.</p>

            <p>I enjoy traveling and meeting new cultures, I lived in Argentina for several years and it became my second home, I hope Canada earns a spot in my heart as well. In my spare time, I like to read, draw, and watch movies and tv shows.(One of my favorites is <abbr title="Games of Thrones">GOT</abbr>) Aside from this, one of my biggest passions is to learn languages, I speak Spanish, English, and French, and I was learning Korean and Italian but did not finish, hopefully, I will retake them in the near future. I enjoy dancing and listening to any genre of music.</p>
            
            So this is a small scope of who I am and do not forget:
            <br>
