            <p>Hello everybody, my name is Lucia and I come from Bogotá, Colombia. I am currently studying at Algonquin College in Ottawa city. I arrived to Canada on December 11<sup>th</sup> on a pretty windy night, I am not going to lie, the trip was a total odyssey; my flight arrived late, it took forever to receive my study and work permit, I lost my connecting flight, I was relocated to another flight that later got delayed, TWICE, and when I arrived at Ottawa Airport, one of my checked bags was lost.In spite of that, I arrived safe and sound and happy to finally being here. So far, it has been a great experience. I love the snow and how everything turns white. However, What I do not like about winter is the cold and the days are way shorter than back home, it turns dark around 5 pm (Crazy, I know).</p>

            <p>I enjoy travelling and meeting new people from different cultures, I lived in Argentina for several years and it became my second home, I hope Canada earns a spot in my heart as well. In my spare time, I like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>to read.</li>
                <li>to draw.</li>
                <li>to watch movies and tv shows (One of my favorites is <abbr title="Game of Thrones">GOT</abbr>).</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
    
               <p> Aside from this, one of my biggest passions is to learn languages, I speak Spanish, English, and French, and I was learning Korean and Italian but did not finish; hopefully, I will retake them in the near future. I enjoy dancing and listening to any genre of music.</p>
            
            So this is a small scope of who I am and do not forget:
